  #   summary: |
  #     Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am Haoxun Shen, originally from China, currently seeking PhD opportunities to advance my academic and research career.

My research interests lie at the intersection of intelligent control theory, machine learning, and complex physical systems, with a strong emphasis on designing robust, safe, and generalizable performance enhancement for embodied agents.

Specifically, I focus on developing hybrid control architectures that seamlessly integrate model-based methods with data-driven techniques. I aim to enhance the reliability and adaptability of intelligent systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments by leveraging the complementary strengths of structured control and learning-based components. Beyond these, I am also deeply interested in the physical layer of interaction between autonomous agents and their environments.
