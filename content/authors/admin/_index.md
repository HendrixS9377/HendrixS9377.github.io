## About Me

I am Haoxun Shen, currently seeking PhD opportunities to advance my academic and research career.

My research interests lie at the intersection of intelligent control theory, machine learning, and complex physical systems, with a strong emphasis on designing robust, safe, and generalizable performance enhancement for embodied agents.

Specifically, I focus on developing hybrid control architectures that seamlessly integrate model-based methods with data-driven techniques. I aim to enhance the reliability and adaptability of intelligent systems operating in uncertain, dynamic environments by leveraging the complementary strengths of structured control and learning-based components. Beyond these, I am also deeply interested in the physical layer of interaction between autonomous agents and their environments.
