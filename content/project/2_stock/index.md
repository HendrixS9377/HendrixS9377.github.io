Bridged deterministic optimal control and reinforcement learning to develop a stochastic vaccine allocation strategy on individual-level contact networks, enabling robust pandemic response modeling.

## Highlights
- Modeled epidemic spread using a high-dimensional continuous-time Markov process (CTMP) on a contact graph.
- Designed a vaccination policy using policy gradient-based RL, warm-started from a mean-field ODE solution.
- Evaluated policies on metrics like mortality and hospitalizations across synthetic and real-world network topologies.

## Tools
Python, PyTorch, NetworkX, OpenAI Gym
