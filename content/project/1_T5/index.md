This project implements Shield-MPPI, a novel integration of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) with Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, on the F1/10 autonomous racing platform to achieve robust, safe navigation under real-world uncertainty.

Key contributions include:
- **Safety Assurance**: Enforced via discrete-time CBFs ensuring forward invariance of a predefined safe set.
- **Cost Augmentation and Control Filtering**: Augmented MPPI trajectory costs with CBF penalties and applied gradient-based filtering to guarantee real-time safety.
- **Robustness Evaluation**: Assessed system under disturbances, noise, and model mismatch in simulated and physical racing environments.
- **Computational Feasibility**: Validated Shield-MPPIâ€™s real-time performance on resource-limited platforms.

The approach demonstrates significant improvement over baseline MPPI in terms of collision avoidance, track adherence, and robustness.
