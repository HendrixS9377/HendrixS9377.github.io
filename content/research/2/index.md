In this project, I contributed to a comprehensive study on the migration patterns of scientists and their impacts on various fields of research. The key activities and findings from this research are outlined below.

## Dataset Development
We developed a large-scale dataset encompassing **200 million records**, which included data on over **350,000 scientists** and **630,000 academic positions** across **19 fields**, primarily focusing on **medicine, chemistry, materials science, computer science,** and **biology**. This extensive dataset serves as the foundation for analyzing trends in scientist migration and its implications.

## Attrition and Attraction Rates Analysis
We analyzed the **attrition rates** and **attraction rates** of postdoctoral and faculty scientists across different countries. This analysis allowed for the mapping of global scientific talent movement, highlighting the countries and regions that are gaining or losing scientific expertise.

## Comparative Analysis
We conducted a comparative analysis of domestic and foreign scientists over time, focusing on metrics such as **innovation, citation counts, productivity,** and **popularity**. Statistical significance was determined using **t-tests**, enabling a robust evaluation of differences between these groups.

## National Policy Comparison
The project also involved a comparison of national policies regarding requirements for domestic and foreign scientists. This comparison was based on citation counts, productivity, and interdisciplinary collaboration, providing insights into how different countries attract and retain scientific talent.

## Survival Analysis
Lastly, I formulated a **log-rank test** to compare the survival probabilities of scientists across **genders, countries,** and **fields** over a span of **seven decades**. This analysis sheds light on the long-term trajectories of scientific careers and the factors influencing their success.

## Conclusion
The research conducted during this period has provided valuable insights into the dynamics of scientist migration, including its implications for national policies and global scientific collaboration. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding these trends to enhance the retention and attraction of scientific talent in various fields.
