In this project, I focused on developing and refining methods to quantitatively assess individual author contributions within research papers. The key activities and findings from this research are summarized below.

## Quantitative Evaluation Metrics
We formulated **quantitative evaluation metrics** to assess individual author contributions in research papers. This framework enables a systematic comparison of authorship credit, addressing the challenges of fairly attributing credit among co-authors.

## Collective Credit Allocation (CCA)
We implemented and refined the **Collective Credit Allocation (CCA)** model, which was applied to analyze author credit distribution across an extensive corpus of over **10,000 academic literature** items. This model allows for a more nuanced understanding of how contributions are distributed among authors, enhancing the transparency and fairness of authorship recognition.

## Conclusion
The research conducted has significant implications for academic publishing and authorship practices. By establishing robust metrics and models, this work aims to promote equitable recognition of contributions in collaborative research efforts.
